there is an engine I plan on using; it’s in development, so this game idea and progress are on hold until then. RPGMaker was a fallout for me; I felt too restricted in what I wanted to do and could do without having to pay someone to help me. I don’t have anything against coders that release plugins, but the amount of lag and the lost data due to data corruption was unsettling. At times, my last project, I was working on all the progress went dark, and I became unable to load the project file.
